<h4>Thesis Abstract</h4>
<p> 
The security of CWSN is challenged by several factors, particularly when it comes
to applications requiring a high level of security, such as military surveillance, emer-
gency response, and healthcare services. Indeed, the sensors are considered resource-
constrained and are not tamper-resistant. They are usually deployed in hostile or
even insecure environments, making them vulnerable to cyber-attacks that can com-
promise sensitive data and adversely affect the good operation of the network. More-
over, wireless communications within the CWSN are insecure by nature. As a re-
sult, an adversary with a wireless device can easily listen in on communications
between legitimate nodes. Therefore, basic security requirements such as authenti-
cation, data confidentiality, and data integrity must be assured. Also necessary to
design a lightweight, efficient, and secure scheme that considers the constrained re-
sources of sensor nodes, particularly the available energy. The main objective of this
thesis is to overcome the security issues associated with the CWSNs. In this context,
we propose three efficient security schemes called HCBS, IDSP, and IBAKAS. Our
proposals are built upon a perfect trade-off between three core elements: (i) a good
level of security, particularly against the various cyber-attacks that target CWSNs,
(ii) resource efficiency, (iii) ease of distribution and management of cryptographic
keys between sensor nodes. HCBS is tested on the TOSSIM simulator using the Mi-
caZ platform. While, IDSP and IBAKAS are tested using a Cooja simulator and the
WiSMote platform. According to obtained results, our proposals are secure, efficient,
and suitable for CWSNs compared to recent related schemes.
